# Ethical Considerations for CRISPR Gene Editing

---

# CRISPR is relative new technology for editing DNA of living organisms

* identifies specific DNA sequences to target
* delete, change, or add to those sequences

---

# Significant advance over previous approaches

* broadly applicable (in principle can change any DNA sequence in the genome)
* very accurate and precise (though does not completely eliminate errors)
* fast, easy, and cheap (kits available online for $150)
* can circumvent natural evolution via gene drive

---

# Ethical Concerns

*  The power of CRISPR highlights ethical issues with gene editing that previously could be dismissed as "purely academic"
* Ecosystem disruption (e.g. using CRISPR to eliminate mosquitos that carry malaria => many migrating birds spend entire seasons in the arctic where mosquitos are their major food source)

---

# Ethical Concerns when Applied to Humans

* Necessity vs. convenience (curing Huntington's Disease vs. boosting child's IQ)
* Informed consent (e.g. when applied to embryos or from state coercion)
* Effect on social equality (if not available to all)

---

# Special Complications

* Researchers not limited to traditional scientists
* Even "isolated" experiments may have wide-ranging impact due to unintended consequences
* Traditional research ethics process (IRBs, funding restrictions, etc.) may be inadequate (researchers have already defied the voluntary moratorium on human embryo experimentation)

---

# Steps towards a solution

* Public education (general public should be involved in the ethical decisions regarding the technology)
* Legislation (if public consensus is that constraints should be placed on the technology)
* International coordination (e.g. if Zambia decides to eliminate mosquitos, that would also eliminate mosquitos from Tanzania, etc.)
