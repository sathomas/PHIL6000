### Ethical Considerations for CRISPR Gene Editing

---

### CRISPR is a relatively new technology for editing DNA of living organisms

* identifies specific DNA sequences to target
* delete, change, or add to those sequences

---

### Significant advance over previous approaches

* broadly applicable (in principle can change any DNA sequence in the genome)
* very accurate and precise (though does not completely eliminate errors)
* fast, easy, and cheap (kits available online for $150)
* can circumvent natural evolution via gene drive

### Ethical Concerns

* The power of CRISPR highlights ethical issues with gene editing that previously could be dismissed as "purely academic"
* Ecosystem disruption
* Incomplete understanding
* Intrinsic errors in the technology
* Errors in its application

+++

* using CRISPR to eliminate mosquitos that carry malaria => many migrating birds spend entire seasons in the arctic where mosquitos are their major food source)
* engineered species may have competitive advantage over existing member of the species or other species, could lead to homogenized gene pool and decreased biodiversity
* a virus that was engineered to simulate human lung cancer in mice could have easily lead to human infections if there were mistakes in the design of the guide RNA

"Bruce Harrison, an entomologist at the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Winston-Salem estimates that the number of migratory birds that nest in the tundra could drop by more than 50% without mosquitoes to eat." http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.html

### Ethical Concerns when Applied to Humans

* Necessity vs. convenience (curing Cystic fibrosis vs. boosting child's IQ)
* Informed consent (e.g. when applied to embryos or from state coercion)
* Effect on social equality (if not available to all)

---

### Special Complications

* Researchers not limited to traditional scientists
* Even "isolated" experiments may have wide-ranging impact due to unintended consequences
* Traditional research ethics process (IRBs, funding restrictions, etc.) may be inadequate (researchers have already defied the voluntary moratorium on human embryo experimentation)

+++

* "Teams from the Alverno High School [...] will receive grants of up to US$5,000 for use as they choose to participate in the competition."

* "CRISPR has been done by high school students."

### Steps towards a solution

* Public education (general public should be involved in the ethical decisions regarding the technology)
* Legislation (if public consensus is that constraints should be placed on the technology)
* International coordination (e.g. if Zambia decides to eliminate mosquitos, that would also eliminate mosquitos from Tanzania, etc.)
